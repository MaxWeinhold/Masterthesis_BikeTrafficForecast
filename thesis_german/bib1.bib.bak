  abstract = {We present a study, where we used regression in order to predict the number of bicycles registered by a bicycle counter (located in Malmö, Sweden). In particular, we compared two regression problems, differing only in their target variables (one using the absolute number of bicycles as target variable and the other one using the deviation from a long-term trend estimate of the expected number of bicycles as target variable). Our results show that using the trend curve deviation as target variable has potential to improve the prediction accuracy (compared to using the absolute number of bicycles as target variable). The results also show that support vector regression (using 2nd and 3rd degree polynomial kernels) and regression trees perform best for our problem.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed air pollution is an obstacle to cycling as it has negative effects on cyclists’ health outcomes and deteriorates their cycling experiences. However, the empirical studies investigating the impact of air pollution on cycling behaviour remains scarce. The aim of this paper is to fill the gap by looking at Beijing as a case study. The authors conducted a survey of 307 cyclists on the days with different levels of air quality in terms of concentration of PM2.5 in 2015. The results show that in the polluted weather, those who persist in cycling are more likely to be male, over 30 years old, lower income or those who travel short distances. Specifically, female cyclists have a higher tendency to shift from cycling to public transit than the males and medium and high-income earners are more likely to shift to using a car than low income earners. The residents’ subjective perceptions of safety and comfort have major effects on their cycling behaviour. A higher perception of comfort and safety is related to a higher possibility of continuing cycling when air quality became polluted. Cycling for commuting trips is less likely to be replaced by other modes than cycling for non-commuting trips, such as shopping. Results of this study reveal that improving air quality in a metropolitan area such as Beijing has co-benefits of cycling renaissance. The huge investments into cycling infrastructure should be integrated with policies designed to create an attractive environment for cycling.},

Adding street-level variables improved out-of-sample prediction accuracy of bicycling and walking activities. We also found that street-level variables (10-fold CV R2: 0.82–0.88) may be a useful alternative to Census data (0.85–0.88). Macro-scale factors (e.g., zoning) captured by Census data and micro-scale factors (e.g., streetscapes) captured in our street-level data are both useful for predicting active travel. Our models provide a new tool for estimating and understanding the spatial patterns of active travel.},

  abstract = {To investigate the factors predicting severity of bicycle crashes in Italy, we used an observational study of official statistics. We applied two of the most widely used data mining techniques, CHAID decision tree technique and Bayesian network analysis. We used data provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics on road crashes that occurred on the Italian road network during the period ranging from 2011 to 2013. In the present study, the dataset contains information about road crashes occurred on the Italian road network during the period ranging from 2011 to 2013. We extracted 49,621 road accidents where at least one cyclist was injured or killed from the original database that comprised a total of 575,093 road accidents. CHAID decision tree technique was employed to establish the relationship between severity of bicycle crashes and factors related to crash characteristics (type of collision and opponent vehicle), infrastructure characteristics (type of carriageway, road type, road signage, pavement type, and type of road segment), cyclists (gender and age), and environmental factors (time of the day, day of the week, month, pavement condition, and weather). CHAID analysis revealed that the most important predictors were, in decreasing order of importance, road type (0.30), crash type (0.24), age of cyclist (0.19), road signage (0.08), gender of cyclist (0.07), type of opponent vehicle (0.05), month (0.04), and type of road segment (0.02). These eight most important predictors of the severity of bicycle crashes were included as predictors of the target (i.e., severity of bicycle crashes) in Bayesian network analysis. Bayesian network analysis identified crash type (0.31), road type (0.19), and type of opponent vehicle (0.18) as the most important predictors of severity of bicycle crashes.},

  abstract  = {Bike-sharing systems are widely deployed in many major cities, providing a convenient transportation mode for citizens' commutes. As the rents/returns of bikes at different stations in different periods are unbalanced, the bikes in a system need to be rebalanced frequently. Real-time monitoring cannot tackle this problem well as it takes too much time to reallocate the bikes after an imbalance has occurred. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical prediction model to predict the number of bikes that will be rent from/returned to each station cluster in a future period so that reallocation can be executed in advance. We first propose a bipartite clustering algorithm to cluster bike stations into groups, formulating a two-level hierarchy of stations. The total number of bikes that will be rent in a city is predicted by a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT). Then a multi-similarity-based inference model is proposed to predict the rent proportion across clusters and the inter-cluster transition, based on which the number of bikes rent from/ returned to each cluster can be easily inferred. We evaluate our model on two bike-sharing systems in New York City (NYC) and Washington D.C. (D.C.) respectively, confirming our model's advantage beyond baseline approaches (0.03 reduction of error rate), especially for anomalous periods (0.18/0.23 reduction of error rate).},

The data were retrieved from Seoul Public Data Park website, which records the counts of public bike rentals in Seoul of Korea from January 1 to December 31, 2020. We found that the two best models are the random forest and the support vector machine models. Among the 29 features in six categories the features in the weather, pollution, and Covid-19 outbreak categories are the most important in model prediction. While almost all social economic features are the least important, we found that they help enhance the performance of the models.},

  year     = {2020},
  month    = dec,
  abstract = {Continuous development of urban infrastructure with a focus on sustainable transportation has led to a proliferation of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as bicyclists and pedestrians, at intersections. Intersection safety evaluation has primarily relied on historical crash data. However, due to several limitations, including rarity, unpredictability, and irregularity of crash occurrences, quantitative and qualitative analyses of crashes may not be accurate. To transcend these limitations, intersection safety can be proactively evaluated by quantifying near-crashes using alternative measures known as surrogate safety measures (SSMs). This study focuses on developing models to predict critical near-crashes between vehicles and bicycles at intersections based on SSMs and kinematic data. Video data from ten signalized intersections in the city of San Diego were employed to train logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) models. A variation of time-to-collision called T<sub>2</sub> and postencroachment time (PET) were used to specify monitoring periods and to identify critical near-crashes, respectively. Four scenarios were created using two thresholds of 5 and 3&} # x2009;s for both PET and T<sub>2</sub>. In each scenario, five
	monitoring period lengths were examined. The RF model was superior
	compared to other models in all different scenarios and across different
	monitoring period lengths. The results also showed a small trade-off
	between model performance and monitoring period length, identifying
	models with monitoring period lengths of 10 and 20 frames performed
	slightly better than those with lower or higher lengths. Sequential
	backward and forward feature selection methods were also applied
	that enhanced model performance. The best RF model had recall values
	of 85& #{x0025; or higher across all scenarios. Also, RF prediction models performed better when considering just the rear-end near-crashes with recalls of above 90&#x0025;.},

  abstract  = {Our cities are significantly changing their structure and organization. These changes have given rise to the need to introduce new services able to rationalize the activities present in such a complex context. Within this scenario, one of the most important services is related to transport management. A proper transport system management can significantly improve the overall quality of life of citizens, in terms of improving air quality, reducing road traffic and ensuring the public transport schedule. In addition to the traditional services and urban traffic management approaches, a significant contribution may come from the adoption of all those IT systems, which are part of the so-called Internet of things. According to this paradigm, it is possible to design an added value and pervasive services in order to assist the users involved in the system. Although this approach could be considered interesting and promising, it is necessary to introduce methodologies able to manage data coming from several heterogeneous sensors in order to process and propose coherent information. In this paper, we propose the using of three graphic approaches able to process the information coming from various sources in order to manage urban transport systems. The three models of representation, on which to conduct inference processes are context dimension tree, ontology and Bayes network. These three approaches allow the creation of inference processes, which represent the basis of value-added services to be offered to several users. The aim of this paper is to present a service that through a multilevel approach, which takes advantage of three models of graphic representation, is able to analyse data from various sensors in an urban area in order to predict the bicycle-sharing public service usage in the city of London. Through the intersection and analysis of data from cameras, weather and transport sensors, it will be possible to establish in which condition there will be an increase or decrease of bicycle rental in order to manage the service. The results obtained on data collected in real scenarios are very satisfying.},

Space syntax analysis is evaluated as a tool for network assessment on the basis of its potential to predict patterns of travel over different network configurations. The theory behind space syntax is evaluated and then tested by using data from the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts. A good model for predicting bicycle volumes within a network can be constructed by using only census data and the space syntax measure “choice.” Unlike existing bicycle suitability measures, space syntax describes the importance of segments to the connectivity or completeness of the network.},

A spatial Bayesian modelling approach is proposed using a binary dependent variable (accident, no accident at location i) constructed from a case–control strategy. Control sites are sampled along the ‘bikeable’ road network in function of the potential bicycle traffic transiting in each ward. Risk factors are limited to infrastructure, traffic and environmental characteristics. Results suggest that a high risk is statistically associated with the presence of on-road tram tracks, bridges without cycling facility, complex intersections, proximity to shopping centres or garages, and busy van and truck traffic. Cycle facilities built at intersections and parked vehicles located next to separated cycle facilities are also associated with an increased risk, whereas contraflow cycling is associated with a reduced risk. The cycling accident risk is far from being negligible in points where there is actually no reported cycling accident but where they are yet expected to occur. Hence, mapping predicted accident risks provides planners and policy makers with a useful tool for accurately locating places with a high potential risk even before accidents actually happen. This also provides comprehensible information for orienting cyclists to the safest routes in Brussels.},

Although cycling is an option for many commuters, a considerable number of them choose to use other forms of transport. In order to underpin policies that promote commuting by bicycle, this paper investigates the determinants for commuting to work. As many bicycle commuters do not cycle every day, we also examine people’s daily choices, in terms of frequency. We conducted a survey of the current literature in order to identify the determinants for commuting by bicycle. We found many determinants, not all of which are addressed by conventional mode choice studies and models. This suggests that predicting and influencing bicycle use needs to be grounded in other kinds of knowledge than those currently available for motorized forms of transport.},

  abstract = {Big Data has begun to create significant impacts in urban and transport planning. This paper covers the explosion in data-driven research on cycling, most of which has occurred in the last ten years. We review the techniques, objectives and findings of a growing number of studies we have classified into three groups according to the nature of the data they are based on: GPS data (spatio-temporal data collected using the global positioning system (GPS)), live point data and journey data. We discuss the movement from small-scale GPS studies to the ‘Big GPS’ data sets held by fitness and leisure apps or specific cycling initiatives, the impact of Bike Share Programmes (BSP) on the availability of timely point data and the potential of historical journey data for trend analysis and pattern recognition. We conclude by pointing towards the possible new insights through combining these data sets with each other -- and with more conventional health, socio-demographic or transport data.},

  abstract = {Cyclists confronted by disruptions to facilities (e.g., dedicated paths, designated lanes) experience disturbances that prompt them to select sub-optimal facilities to avoid disruptions. Cyclists who have ready access to such improved facilities often choose sub-optimal facilities. This project collected a variety of data to help gain a better understanding of commuter cyclist behavior using Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment to record cyclist movements and behaviors. Using GPS units for data collection provides significant data for analysis, however, a substantial and unexpected amount of effort went into determining the best operational use of the GPS units and verifying data collection protocols. Among important findings, results show that as perceived safety decreases, riders appear to be more cautious and move more slowly; however in situations of substantial perceived danger, riders go faster to spend as short a time in unsafe conditions. Cyclists choose these dangerous situations over alternatives because of lessened travel times. The research has been successful in establishing insightful relationships between commuter cyclist behavior and facilities. The methodological results are significant for future work.},

It employs an improved mode detection algorithm for GPS post-processing to determine trips made by bicycle, which are map matched to an enriched street network. The alternatives are generated as a random sample from an exhaustive, but constrained search. Accounting for the similarity between the alternatives with the path-size factor the MNL estimates show that the elasticity with regards to trip length is nearly four times larger than that with respect to the share of bike paths. The elasticity with respect to the product of length and maximum gradient of the route is small. No other variable describing the routes had an impact. The heterogeneity of the cyclists is captured through interaction terms formulated on their average behaviour.},

Advancements in technologies and the proliferation of smartphones have created new data sources that can help eliminate limitations related to small sample size and infrequent updates due to limited resources. This study reviews the emerging data sources and their current use, focusing on non-motorized travel monitoring. In this study, the emerging data are categorized into mode-unspecified and mode-specified data based on whether the mode used can be detected with no or little effort. While mode-unspecified data are collected without sorting out non-motorized travelers, mode-specified data at least know who (which mode) is being monitored. So far, commercial vendors provide a vast volume of mode-unspecified data, but their products have been mainly used for motorized trips or are in initial stages of development. Meanwhile, readily available data sources and their applications are more concentrated on mode-specified data, which have enabled varying non-motorized travel studies—including travel pattern identification, route-choice modeling, crash/air pollution exposure estimation, and new facility provision evaluation—but are mostly focused on bicycling. Despite the potential of emerging data, their use also has several challenges, such as limited mode inference, sample bias, and lack of detailed trip/traveler information due to privacy issues. More efforts are needed, such as improving data accuracy and developing robust data fusion techniques, to be able to fully utilize the emerging data sources.},

  abstract = {US municipalities are increasingly introducing bicycle lanes to promote bicycle use, increase roadway safety and improve public health. The aim of this study was to identify specific locations where bicycle lanes, if created, could most effectively reduce crash rates. Previous research has found that bike lanes reduce crash incidence, but a lack of comprehensive bicycle traffic flow data has limited researchers’ ability to assess relationships at high spatial resolution. We used Bayesian conditional autoregressive logit models to relate the odds that a bicycle injury crash occurred on a street segment in Philadelphia, PA (n = 37,673) between 2011 and 2014 to characteristics of the street and adjacent intersections. Statistical models included interaction terms to address the problem of unknown bicycle traffic flows, and found bicycle lanes were associated with reduced crash odds of 48% in streets segments adjacent to 4-exit intersections, of 40% in streets with one- or two-way stop intersections, and of 43% in high traffic volume streets. Presence of bicycle lanes was not associated with change in crash odds at intersections with less or more than 4 exits, at 4-way stop and signalized intersections, on one-way streets and streets with trolley tracks, and on streets with low-moderate traffic volume. The effectiveness of bicycle lanes appears to depend most on the configuration of the adjacent intersections and on the volume of vehicular traffic. Our approach can be used to predict specific street segments on which the greatest absolute reduction in bicycle crash odds could occur by installing new bicycle lanes.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between bicycle crash frequency and their contributing factors at the census block group level in Florida, USA. Crashes aggregated over the census block groups tend to be clustered (i.e., spatially dependent) rather than randomly distributed. To account for the effect of spatial dependence across the census block groups, the class of conditional autoregressive (CAR) models were employed within the hierarchical Bayesian framework. Based on four years (2011-2014) of crash data, total and fatal-and-severe injury bicycle crash frequencies were modeled as a function of a large number of variables representing demographic and socio-economic characteristics, roadway infrastructure and traffic characteristics, and bicycle activity characteristics. This study explored and compared the performance of two CAR models, namely the Besag’s model and the Leroux’s model, in crash prediction. The Besag’s models, which differ from the Leroux’s models by the structure of how spatial autocorrelation are specified in the models, were found to fit the data better. A 95% Bayesian credible interval was selected to identify the variables that had credible impact on bicycle crashes. A total of 21 variables were found to be credible in the total crash model, while 18 variables were found to be credible in the fatal-and-severe injury crash model. Population, daily vehicle miles traveled, age cohorts, household automobile ownership, density of urban roads by functional class, bicycle trip miles, and bicycle trip intensity had positive effects in both the total and fatal-and-severe crash models. Educational attainment variables, truck percentage, and density of rural roads by functional class were found to be negatively associated with both total and fatal-and-severe bicycle crash frequencies.},

Since a variety of other economic data come in the form of repeated counts of some individual actions or events, the methodology should have wide applications. The statistical models we develop are applications and generalizations of Poisson distribution. Two important issues are (i) Given the panel nature of our data, how can we allow for separate persistent individual (fixed or random) effects? (ii) How does one introduce the equivalent of disturbances-in-the-equation into the analysis of Poisson and other discrete probability functions? The first problem is solved by conditioning on the total sum of outcomes over the observed years, while the second problem is solved by introducing an additional source of randomness, allowing the Poisson parameter to be itself randomly distributed, and compounding the two distributions. Lastly, we develop a test statistic for the presence of serial correlation when fixed effects estimators are used in nonlinear conditional models.},

In brain disorders research, SVMs are typically employed using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) because their relative simplicity carries a lower risk of overfitting even using high-dimensional imaging data. More recently, SVMs have been used in the context of precision psychiatry, particularly for applications that involve predicting diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression.

The SVM concepts presented in Chapter 3can be generalized to become applicable to regression problems. As in classification, support vector regression (SVR) is characterized by the use of kernels, sparse solution, and VC control of the margin and the number of support vectors. Although less popular than SVM, SVR has been proven to be an effective tool in real-value function estimation. As a supervised-learning approach, SVR trains using a symmetrical loss function, which equally penalizes high and low misestimates. Using Vapnik's -insensitive approach, a flexible tube of minimal radius is formed symmetrically around the estimated function, such that the absolute values of errors less than a certain threshold are ignored both above and below the estimate. In this manner, points outside the tube are penalized, but those within the tube, either above or below the function, receive no penalty. One of the main advantages of SVR is that its computational complexity does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space. Additionally, it has excellent generalization capability, with high prediction accuracy.},

Using data from 122 automated bicycle counting stations in 30 German cities, and a composite index of adverse weather conditions that consists of air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and cloud coverage, we calculate city-specific weather elasticities of the level of utilitarian cycling. The results show that these weather elasticities vary significantly between cities. Our next step is to analyze various determinants of weather elasticities, which reveals that the share of young inhabitants and the density of the cycle network have a positive impact on weather resilience. Based on the notion that resilience to adverse weather conditions reflects a revealed part of a city's bicycle culture, the weather elasticities can be used to create a ranking of bicycle cities. This ranking is positively correlated with a ranking based on the modal share of cycling, as well as with other rankings based on stated preference surveys or external conditions such as infrastructure or cycling safety.},

  abstract = {Bicycle use varies strongly between countries, and even between municipalities within the same country substantial variations may exist. This paper analyses to what extent municipality policies matter in explaining these variations. It appears that most of the inter-municipality variation in bicycle use is related to physical aspects such as altitude differences and city size, and features of the population (share of youngsters). Differences in ethnic composition also appear to matter. Important policy-related variables are: the number of stops cyclists have to make on their routes; hindrances in road use; and safety of cyclists. In addition the relative position of bicycles with respect to cars (speed, parking costs) also appears to matter. These results shed light on various components of the cyclists' generalised costs, such as those related to accidents and physical efforts, that are not usually considered. We also conclude that cultural tradition, possibly related to ethnicity deserves a more explicit role in travel surveys and the analysis of travel behaviour than it usually receives.},

  abstract       = {Due to the increasingly complex objects and massive information involved in spatial statistics analysis, least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) with a good stability and high calculation speed is widely applied in regression problems of geospatial objects. According to Tobler’s First Law of Geography, near things are more related than distant things. However, very few studies have focused on the spatial dependence between geospatial objects via SVR. To comprehensively consider the spatial and attribute characteristics of geospatial objects, a geospatial LS-SVR model for geospatial data regression prediction is proposed in this paper. The 0–1 type and numeric-type spatial weight matrices are introduced as dependence measures between geospatial objects and fused into a single regression function of the LS-SVR model. Comparisons of the results obtained with the proposed and conventional models and other traditional models indicate that fusion of the spatial weight matrix can improve the prediction accuracy. The proposed model is more suitable for geospatial data regression prediction and enhances the ability of geospatial phenomena to explain geospatial data.},

It is shown both theoretically and by simulation that one-sided cross-validation is much less adversely affected by correlation than is ordinary cross-validation. The former method is a reliable means of window width selection in the presence of moderate levels of serial correlation, while the latter is not. It is also shown that ordinary cross-validation is less robust to correlation when applied to Gasser–Müller kernel estimators than to local linear ones.},
